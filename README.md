# Ballsdex Value Calculator
This is a calculator made for calculating the value of Countryballs.
The calculator is still in beta. Many things will change in the future.
If you don't own a Java compiler, you can run the code here: https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/online-compiler/

## Calculator Guide
When you have to input the 'rank', you should submit the rarity of the ball as shown on the Ballsdex wiki: https://ballsdex.miraheze.org/wiki/Rarity_List

the "Attack modifier" and "Health modifier" are self-explanatory. Just submit the percentage bonus of each stat when asked. (Example: +20% or 20)
If your ball is shiny, submit "true" when asked. Otherwise, you should submit "false."
The event functionality is coming soon.
